  - AuditLog.Read.All

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ca-automation.git
cd ca-automation
```

2. Install required PowerShell modules:
```powershell
./scripts/setup/install-dependencies.ps1
```

3. Configure your environment:
```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your environment settings (ensure .env is in .gitignore)
```

## 🚦 Quick Start

1. **Basic Policy Deployment**
```powershell
Import-Module ./src/modules/policy-management/policy_manager.ps1

$policyManager = [ConditionalAccessPolicyManager]::new($TenantId)
$policyManager.DeployPolicy("./templates/policies/security-baseline.yaml")
```

2. **Compliance Assessment**
```powershell
$complianceManager = [ComplianceManager]::new($TenantId)
$report = $complianceManager.AssessCompliance("ISO27001")
$report.GenerateReport("./reports/compliance-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').pdf")
```

3. **Risk Analysis**
```powershell
$riskAssessor = [RiskAssessor]::new()
$riskReport = $riskAssessor.AnalyzePolicies()
$riskReport.ExportFindings("./reports/risk-assessment.xlsx")
```

## 📊 Sample Dashboard
