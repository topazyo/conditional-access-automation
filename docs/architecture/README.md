# Conditional Access Automation Architecture

This document outlines the architectural decisions and implementation details for the Conditional Access Automation framework.

## Core Components

### Policy Management Module
- Handles policy creation, updates, and deletion
- Implements risk assessment logic
- Manages policy dependencies and conflicts

### Compliance Module
- Tracks compliance requirements
- Generates compliance reports
- Maintains audit trails

### Reporting Module
- Generates operational metrics
- Tracks policy effectiveness
- Provides business impact analysis

## Security Considerations

1. Authentication
   - Uses Microsoft Graph API with least-privilege access
   - Implements certificate-based authentication
   - Supports managed identities

2. Authorization
   - Role-based access control for policy management
   - Audit logging for all operations
   - Separation of duties enforcement

3. Data Protection
   - Secure storage of configurations
   - Encryption of sensitive data
   - Secure logging practices

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Policy Development
   - Follow least-privilege principle
   - Implement gradual rollout capability
   - Include rollback procedures

2. Testing Requirements
   - Unit tests for all core functions
   - Integration tests for policy deployment
   - Performance testing for large-scale deployments

3. Monitoring and Alerting
   - Real-time policy deployment monitoring
   - Alert on policy conflicts
   - Track policy effectiveness metrics
