# Conditional Access Policy Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- Azure AD Premium P2 License
- Global Administrator or Security Administrator role
- PowerShell 7.2 or higher
- Required PowerShell modules:
  - Microsoft.Graph # For interacting with Azure AD and Conditional Access policies
  - Pester # For running unit and integration tests (development/testing environment)
  # Az.Accounts and Az.Resources are not directly used by the core modules, which rely on Microsoft.Graph.

## Environment Setup

### 1. Authentication Configuration
```powershell
# Configure service principal
$spConfig = @{
    Name = "CA-Automation-SP"
    Role = "Security Administrator"
    Scope = "/subscriptions/$subscriptionId"
}

# Create and configure service principal
./scripts/setup/configure-service-principal.ps1 @spConfig
```
(Note: The script `configure-service-principal.ps1` is a conceptual placeholder for future enhancement. Manual Service Principal creation or other authentication methods should be used as per your organization's standards. Refer to Microsoft Graph documentation for required permissions.)

### 2. Policy Staging Process

#### Development Environment
```powershell
# Deploy to development
./scripts/deployment/deploy-policies.ps1 `
    -Environment Development `
    -ConfigPath ./templates/policies/dev-policies.yaml `
    -WhatIf
```
(Note: The script `deploy-policies.ps1` with parameters like `-Environment` and `-EnableMonitoring` is a conceptual placeholder. The current primary deployment script is `scripts/deployment/deploy.ps1`, which uses parameters such as `-ConfigPath 'path/to/your/policy/definitions/'` and `-WhatIf` for individual or bulk policy deployment from local YAML/JSON definitions.)

#### Staging Environment
```powershell
# Deploy to staging with monitoring
./scripts/deployment/deploy-policies.ps1 `
    -Environment Staging `
    -ConfigPath ./templates/policies/staging-policies.yaml `
    -EnableMonitoring
```
(Note: The script `deploy-policies.ps1` is a conceptual placeholder. Refer to `scripts/deployment/deploy.ps1` for current deployment capabilities, which do not include environment-specific flags or direct monitoring enablement as shown here.)

#### Production Environment
```powershell
# Production deployment with approval workflow
./scripts/deployment/deploy-policies.ps1 `
    -Environment Production `
    -ConfigPath ./templates/policies/prod-policies.yaml `
    -RequireApproval
```
(Note: The script `deploy-policies.ps1` is a conceptual placeholder. The script `scripts/deployment/deploy.ps1` should be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline with appropriate approval gates for production deployments.)

### 3. Monitoring Setup
```powershell
# Configure Log Analytics workspace
./scripts/setup/configure-monitoring.ps1 `
    -WorkspaceName "ca-monitoring" `
    -RetentionDays 90
```
(Note: The script `configure-monitoring.ps1` is a conceptual placeholder. Monitoring should be configured by setting up Log Analytics and using the `PolicyMonitor` class in `src/modules/reporting/policy_monitor.ps1` to send data, or by leveraging Azure AD's built-in monitoring and audit logs.)

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback
```powershell
# Immediate policy rollback
./scripts/maintenance/rollback-policies.ps1 `
    -PolicyIds $affectedPolicies `
    -Reason "Emergency rollback due to business impact"
```
(Note: The script `rollback-policies.ps1` is a conceptual placeholder. Rollback should be performed by reverting to a previous policy definition in your version control system and re-deploying that version using `scripts/deployment/deploy.ps1` or by manually changing policy states in Azure AD portal in an emergency.)
