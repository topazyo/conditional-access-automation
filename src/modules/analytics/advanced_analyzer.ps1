        # INPUT: Uses $this.AllPolicies
        # FUNCTIONALITY:
        # 1. Identify policies with significantly overlapping conditions (Users, Applications, Locations, etc.)
        #    even if their grant controls or other settings differ.
        # 2. This goes beyond simple conflict detection (which PolicyValidator does).
        #    It looks for scenarios like "Policy A targets All Users for App X, Policy B targets Group Y (subset of All Users) for App X".
        # 3. Output should detail which policies overlap, on what conditions, and potentially highlight
        #    the combined set of controls that would apply.
        # EXAMPLE OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
        # @{
        #     OverlapSets = @(
        #         @{
        #             Policies = @("PolicyName1 (ID1)", "PolicyName2 (ID2)")
        #             OverlappingConditions = @{ Users = "...", Applications = "..." }

        # INPUT: Uses $this.AllPolicies, plus lists of critical user UPNs and application display names/IDs.
        # FUNCTIONALITY:
        # 1. For each critical user/application, determine:
        #    a. If they are covered by AT LEAST ONE 'enabled' Conditional Access policy.
        #    b. How many policies apply to them.
        #    c. What are the effective controls if multiple policies apply (summary).
        # 2. Highlights:
        #    a. Critical users/apps NOT covered by any policy.
        #    b. Critical users/apps covered by an excessive number of policies (potential complexity).
        # EXAMPLE OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
        # @{
        #     UserCoverage = @(
        #         @{ UserUPN = "user1@domain.com"; IsCovered = $true; PolicyCount = 2; EffectiveControls = "MFA, Compliant Device" }
        #         @{ UserUPN = "user2@domain.com"; IsCovered = $false; PolicyCount = 0; EffectiveControls = "None" }

        # INPUT: Specific Policy ID that changed, and the date/time of change. Uses $this.SignInLogs, $this.AuditLogs.
        # FUNCTIONALITY: (Highly conceptual for a placeholder)
        # 1. Analyze sign-in patterns (success/failure rates, MFA challenges) for users/apps affected by the policy
        #    BEFORE and AFTER the $changeDate.
        # 2. Correlate with audit logs for that specific policy change.
        # 3. Attempt to quantify or describe the impact of the policy change.
        # EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
        # @{
        #     PolicyName = "Name of Policy ID"
        #     ChangeDescription = "Details from Audit Log"
        #     ImpactSummary = "Sign-in failures for affected scope increased by X% after change."
